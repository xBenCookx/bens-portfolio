            Hi! I'm Ben, a driven and results-oriented professional enthusiastic about transitioning into the dynamic field of software development.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            With a background in special testing, agricultural chemical sales, and internet technology, I have developed strong analytical problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and a customer-focused mindsetâ€”key attributes in software development.

          <p className="mb-4">
            My experience in special testing sharpened my attention to detail and data analysis, crucial for debugging and writing efficient code. In agricultural chemical sales, I honed my ability to understand client needs and communicate complex solutions effectively, much like collaborating with stakeholders in software projects.
